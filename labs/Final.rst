Submission
*********************

#. Due date: noon, June 1st, 2022

#. Please create your own github repo.

#. Please push your codes and Readme to your github repo.

   - The Readme file should explain: (1) how to setup and run your program (2) what are the results

#. **During the final demo, at least 3 TAs will evaluate your demo and codes.**


********************
Project requirements
********************

#. Please extend HW4's parts to design a complete task for a BB Car navigation.

#. In the task, please include XBee, line detection and location identification.
   You may replace the line detection task with other OpenMV image modules such as image classification with TF Lite.

#. One example task is to (1) follow the line to an object, (2) circle around the object,
   (3) use a AprilTag and PING to calibrate the location, (4) to follow another line to a destination.
   Also the car would send information with XBee at the start and end of each sub-task.

*************
Scoring
*************

#. Complete all requirements

   #. If all planned sub-tasks are finished, the base score will be 80.

#. Extra scores will be added for the following conditions

   #. Smooth navigation of BB Car (+ 5-10pt)

   #. Fast completion of tasks (+ 5-10pt)

   #. Use other advanced modules, e.g., image classification (+ 5-10pt)

**************
Demo process
**************

#. Three TAs will evaluate each project.
#. We will setup a pre-assigned demo group for students. Demo time for each group will be scheduled.
   On 6/16, all in the same group will join the meeting at the same time to demo. If you cannot demo at the time,
   please still join and schedule another time with TAs.
#. You may make an appointment at an earlier date than 6/16.
#. If you cannot demo on 6/16, you may schedule another date with TAs, but there will be a 10% off from your scores.
   Also all demos should be done by 6/23.
